<h1>Origins</h1>
<b><p>Long story short, the galaxy was primarily dominated by 2 major powers perpetually in struggle with one another. One was a planet known as the Aeolian Republic, and the other was a planet known as Rhyseia. Tensions arose between the 2 powers as both tried to gain a foothold of power in the local galaxy. After about 2 years of tension between them, war broke out in 3059, starting what would be known as the first Rhyseian war. The war, which lasted around 3 years, eventually dragged into a stalemate, at which point a peace treaty was signed and an armistice was declared in 3062.<br><br>

Following the war, the Aeolian Republic sought to expand its sphere of influence beyond their home planet leading the Aeolian army to invade many of its neighbors, including an oil-rich planet known as Itenthe. This particular planet was claimed as Rhyseian territory, leading Corrina George, the Rhyseian president at the time, to declare war on Aeolia for a second time in 3066. That particular war did not at first occur necessarily to the Aeolians’ advantage, owing partially  to the vastly expanded military power of the Rhyseian army following the first war, but more so the Aeolian president taking direct control over the military shortly after the start of the war. Eventually, the president relinquished military control to his more experienced generals, gradually turning the tide of the war in the Aeolians’ favor, and following an incursion into the capitol planet itself, the Rhyseians quickly surrendered, ending what would be known as the Second Rhyseian war in 3068. The resulting peace treaty, known as the treaty of Solorum (the name of the Aeolian capital city), saw the Rhyseians be stripped of much of their territory, its military being severely limited, and its capital planet being occupied by Aeolia. Most of its lost territory was then puppeted, being absorbed into the newly-formed greater Aeolian Empire.
However, Aeolia had very little interest in maintaining its dominion over these puppets, being far more concerned with its own stability, as well as that of the territory it had prior to the second Rhyseian War; thus, the puppet governments set up in these planets were mostly left to their own devices, although they couldn’t have their own independent military, and would have had to rely on its occupiers for protection.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the 3072 Rhyseian election saw a group known as Rhyseian Nationalist Party (R.N.P.), headed by president Trenton Mease, assume power; the R.N.P, after successfully hijacking the political system and claiming absolute power over the government, began to vastly rebuild its military, directly violating of the Treaty of Solorum. However, the Aeolian president, Kyler Beryllin, chose not to act, wishing to avoid starting yet another conflict; however, the Rhyseians’ new change in rhetoric and newly aggressive foreign policy was still a serious concern, and thus the Aeolians directed their forces to secure its new colonies to deter any possible invasion(s). <br><br>

One of these colonies was Earth, which at that point was run by one of the puppet governments known as the Democratic Republic of the Whaweios, the precursor to the New Order itself. During this time, the puppet government was stripped and the Aeolian president was given total autonomy over the planet. Already having strained relations with the Aeolians at the time, the Whaweian President which went by the alias "Knight Of War" had finally had enough, but tried to hold a summit with President Beryllin to resolve these issues peacefully. When Beryllin said that these terms weren't negotiable, Knight Of War officially declared Earth's seccession from the Aeolian Empire, which ended up kickstarting a war between the two governments. Although, the Whaweians were severely overmatched, their rebellion coincided with the Rhyesian invasion of the Aeolian's home planet, leaving their military weaker than usual. This war between the empire and Earth lasted until early 3074, when General Taylor dropped a newly developed pathogen known as PAX-12 on the main Aeolian base, which shrank the population of the military stationed there to nothing. The Aeolians still at war with the Rhyesians decided to surrender, leaving the planet Earth to the Whaweios. After the victory, Whaweian President "Knight Of War" decided to change the name of the government to "The New Order" and to give the planet Earth a new name, which was the "Republic of Chiacodia".<br><br>

In the middle of 3074, Colby Mertz decided to leave The New Order with no warning and without reason, he then relocated himself, as well as a group of followers to a small island in the southeast and formed the Defenders Of The Den (D.O.T.D.). By 3075, it had become apparent that the D.O.T.D. was actually invading some of The New Order's southwestern territories which caused the Vice President, Brandon Rother, to send a large military fleet to the island and destroy all living things there. Later that same year, during the presidential election, citizens of the Republic of Chiacodia were surprised to see that Knight Of War was not present on their ballots, despite stating that he intended to run. This led his Vice President to publicly announce that Knight Of War had been assassinated about a year ago by what was assumed to be Colby Mertz. The reason he kept it private for so long was to prevent the citizens from panicking, but after being peer pressured by his fellow government officials, he had no choice but to publicly announce his death. Despite some obvious heavy backlash by the citizens, Brandon managed to narrowly win the presidential election against Nathan Nichols, making Nichols the new Vice President.</p></b>
