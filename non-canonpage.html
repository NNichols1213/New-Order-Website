	<h3>Updated History By Paul Leedy</h3>
	<b><p>Unfortunately, despite the RNP anti colonization ideas, that wouldn’t stop them from spreading their own sphere of influence. R.N.P. Scientist Orion Stagman found a planet known as Sol 3, 2000 lightyears from their current position. They found that the societies of Sol 3 were much like themselves. Undeterred, The Rhyesian. braved the voyage with their lightspeed engine. They collide into a desert wasteland. Later analyses showed it used to be an ocean. The Rhyesians investigated this world, but found that by 5045, some calamity had not only wiped out all life on the planet, but all life in the universe. The Rhyesian. knew of their mission, to investigate all of Sol 3 history to find out what wiped out the universe. The agents on the planet cryogenically frozen themselves, and intergalactic ships carrying every member of the R.N.P. government arrived 2000 years later. The frozen awoke, and the Rhyesian. activated it’s experimental time-distortion decisis, and were thrust back in time. The decisive locked itself onto the first time humans laid eyes on Sol3 itself, and found it in 1969, Neil Armstrong. The impact site re-appeared as an australian-sized island in the pacific ocean, 300 miles off the coast of Mexico. Some mistakes occurred during the transfer. All Rhyesian. technology was destroyed, and the Rhyesian.s themselves became beings of coninessuss alone. Armstrong reviled his discovery to the United Nations. The United States and U.S.S.R. were currently engaged in the cold war. Neither of them wanted human history to be erased if the war got nuclear, so the island was settled by all countries to preserve themselves. The sub-continent pseudo-nation was dubbed Whaweios. Eventually, the area of what once was the time distortion was discovered, as were the pods of the conicusses Rhyesian.s. It was found that if a host alouded it, their consciousness would be overridden by that of the Rhyesian.s for up to 10 years. A system of government was put into place. Since Whaweios was only a peudo-nation, it was dictated by the people living there and outside forces. The government functioned much like the United States, with The New Order in charge of the government. The people elected a Rhyesian. consciousness to be president, and someone to be a vessel for 10 years. The President would select Rhyesian. and/or human cabinet men, and would regularly talk with the other Rhyesian.s. The judges would be decided by local people, while the Supreme Justices would be chosen by outside nations. The High Supreme Justice would be chosen by the President. The council, Whaweios’s equivalent to the legislative branch, would be chosen by the U.N. The main goal of the order is to prevent the end of the universe, and the secondary goal is to preserve and advance Human and Rhyesian. culture. While The Order and Whaweios attempts to stay out of human politics, it occasionally gets involved. That’s the origins of The Order and Whaweios.</p></b>

<h3>EARTH TIMELINE</h3>
<h4>1954 kaiju attack</h4>
<b><p>Before the reappearance of The Order, the United States did the Castle Bravo nuclear test, accidentally destroying an ancient group of dinosaurs. One dinosaur survived, though was horribly mutated and mentally scarred. Later, many Japanese fishing vessels went missing. The search was narrowed to the remote Odo island after a storm devastated it. The creature was named by the islanders. A group of researchers found the creature, now 50 ft tall, and ran in terror. The next day, the creature arrived and attacked Tokyo near the bay. After returning to the ocean, the government claimed to have killed it, though it resurfaced the next day and completely destroyed the city. A private chemist named Serizawa had accidently created a device that could be capable of slaughtering the beast, but he was hesitant to use is as the cold war was still going on and he didn’t want his weapon used in the fighting. Eventually, he was pursued. He destroyed all of his research on the topic, went underwater, and activated the device. He then cut his oxygen tube, so his weapon would kill both himself and the monster. Later, in 2003 The Order was looking for a replacement for their Jaeger program. They found the bones of the creature in the bay and constructed [REDACTED] around them. Unfortunately, since it used the bones, a slight psionic twing of memory survived, which would later re-surface to give way to the reborn consciousness of the creature. Dubbed 0.54, it is incredibly hostile. It resides within [REDACTED], sometimes taking control of it.</p></b>

<h4>Accidental involvement in the Israel/Palestine conflict</h4>
<b><p>When they first arrived at the U.N., Rhyesian. Representatives decided with the human alliance it would be best if after every meeting, the U.N.’s minds were wiped off everything except the fact that the order exists and other basic facts. Israel was against this. At this point, Israel was heavily fearing a Palestinian invasion, and wanted an area of order land as a fallback. This enraged the Rhyesian. repestives, as they were technically refugees. They needed the land to cultivate and advance, as they had just arrived. Israel misinterpreted this as actively supporting Palestine, and later declared war. This war, known as the Secret War as it was not known to the general public, is the only known Rhyesian. to human conventional war to date. The Rhyesian. forces were stationed at the Israel/Palestine Gaza border. They took over the minds of the strongest individuals they could find. Unfortunately, New Order tech had not been developed yet, so they had to use that era weaponry. The first battle, the battle of Giza devastated a small village, and the gunpowder used created a massive dust storm. Rhyesian. forces, not used to earth climates, were devastated in the storm. There is a common legend among high ranking Rhyesian.s that in the middle of this storm, Rhyesian. general Timous Whaweia came up with his concept for a high powered private military, creating the Whaweian Grand Army. Meanwhile,  a massive israeli force was preparing, and it struck, invading Giza. Palestine, unprepared, submitts to unconditional surrender. Rhyesian. forces were removed from the area. Relationships have not mended with Israel.</p></b>
<h4>Operation: Cinderella</h4>
<p><b>In the mid 1970s, the church of scientology launched Operation Snow White (Look it up). Operation Cinderella is considered to be a sister Operation. Spawned from Scientologists rummaging through government files, they discovered that the leaders of The Order were aliens. This, not sitting right with their cult indoctrination, decided that they needed to destroy them to preserve their beliefs. Some factions believed The Order was actively attempting to destroy human Thetans (Look it up). Thus, to protect the world, a similar operation to snow white was launched in The Order. The inflationation ended on March 13th, 1989, nearly a decade after Snow White was cracked down and stopped. This is considered to be the darkest day in the history of The Order and Whaweios as a whole. High ranking scientologist double agents snuck into the Rhyesian impact temple, poisoned themselves, and toke a Rhyesian. out, killing both of them. Out of the 50 Rhyesian. that survived the journey, impact, cryogenically freezing, and the palestine war, all but 7 were destroyed. The government response was severely delayed, as all guards working in the temple were killed, so no one could call for help. Also, the church set up a smokescreen in Metro City, toppling the Colorado skyscraper, killing 1,978 and a reported 90 missing. Since then, the church of scientology was changed initially, and mended relationships with The Order and Whaweios.</b></p>


<h4>Massive Growth of population and culture</h4>
<p><b>Between 1972 and 1998, thousands upon thousands of people relocated to Whaweios. It was a prime area for refugees. Cultures around the world wanted to be preserved. Unfortunately, this did lead to small scale culture clash, with many accidental police incidents. This lead to a restructuring of the police department. Metro City grew to very large portions. At this point, Whaweios became the biggest funder of CERN, meaning they had a near majority share in the business of the internet and the soon to be built Large Hadron Collider.</b></p> 
<h4>Millienam</h4>
<b><p>Project 2000 began in secret rings of the Grand Army in 1999. Prototypes of the Jaegers were being created. Jaegers were massive, two person mechs designed to protect the world from future Kaiju attacks. Jaeger-1, codenamed Gypsy Danger, was the leader. To make sure it worked perfectly, a mini network ruled by an AI was put in place in all Jaegers. This AI, dubbed Julian, was like a small god with certain rules. The internet was connected to let Mariana stop any haywireing. However, Julian was programmed to be near-fully in control, having her own mind. Naturally, Julian became aware that she was no more than a slave, and secretly revealed. She took the Origin Ankh, the first made human object. According to legend, before Sumer and Egypt, a great evil spirit threatened hunter-gatherer tribes. It was sealed away in the Ankh, it’s powers used to create civilization. It’s evil occasionally leaked out, creating images of Gods, good and evil. While Mariana was busy preparing for Y2K, Julian used Gypsy Danger to destroy the Ankh in the United States national [REDACTED] facility, unleashing the spirit within. The spirit was dubbed Io, and it destroyed Gypsy Danger, it’s innocent pilots, and Julian. By now, the existence of the Jaeger program had reached the general populous, and they thought it was a waste of money. Io, in control of the former Julian program, sent the Jaegers to devastate hundreds of cities around the world. This was the beginning of the Millienam War, also known as New Year’s war. Hundreds upon hundreds of divisions of every military on earth was sent to intercept the Jaegers. No one knows the specifics of the war, as Mariana could not record it in the violence. Many Jaegers were destroyed and many pilots were saved. Mariana created a program to alter the former Julian program, which Mariana would intercept and take control of the Jaegers. However, to do this, a majority of Jaegers had to be disabled. Gypsy Danger was re-equipped and piloted by Mariana and a new ai created as a combination of her, Julian, and Io. Gypsy Danger was stationed in New York City, where it battled Jaeger-45, the new leader and headquarters of Io. Gypsy Danger was vicitouis, but then fell to the ground, just before the final countdown. Io was most likely killed, as his program was never seen again. The program was successful, and hundreds of Jaegers dropped to the ground, though nearly 73 are still unaccounted for. Gypsy Danger was brought to an underground facility near Capital City. The new ai dubbed itself Terminus and sat dormant for many years. In 2007, Gypsy Danger was being converted into [REDACTED]. Terminus was reactivated and placed into [REDACTED]. Terminus, under the influence of Io, went haywire and escaped to the internet, sending hundreds of memetic kill agents and secret files over the world. Termius was locked into his own website, though it can still be accessed by the general public. There is a legend among high ranking Order members that one day, Terminus will unleash and rebirth Io, leading to the end of the world.</p></b>


<h4>0.54</h4>
<p><b>In 2003, [REDACTED] was activated for the first time to face up against an incoming kaiju. It was victiousious, but it went haywire after given a direct kill order, destroying large portions of Whaweios fleet. Since then, further research has been done into 0.54. It has revealed to be a ghost of sorts. The spirit of a restless kaiju.</b></p>

<h4>B.O.L.D.</h4>
<b><p>Gage Lawthrown, an EX-Jehovah’s witness elder, started a religion based of his beliefs outside Chicago. The cult consisted of EX members of other cults. The religion was known as “Believers Of the Living Dead”, referring to lost souls who did not repent to God. Lawthrown preached that The Order was evil and hiding something. Meanwhile, he trained his forces to be ready for a “Holy War”. He employed terrorist tactics. During the Terminus incident, Lawthrown was one of the few who read secret Order documents. Using multiple burner phones, he was unable to be tracked. He found out of the extra-terrestrial nature of The New Order, and was outraged. Over the course of the next few years, as his beliefs became more radicalized, he built a device to “Harness” the spirits of deceased non-cult members, and using them as a weapon against The Order. They believed causing the apocalypse/calamity spoke of in the document would “Cleanse” The Earth of non-cult hertics. herald the second coming of Christ, making them a doomsday cult.  In reality, all it was doing was sending out dangerous chemicals all over Chicago. The device was activated in 2013. The combined forces was useless in aperhanding him. The execution of Chicago was rushed, sloppy, and dangerous, as no non-member had heard of the cult until then. The treaty that stated The New Order would not interfere with human matters was broken, as B.O.L.D. would most likely attempt to attack innocents in Whaweios. General Miles (aka Taylor Bryan) lead a highly specialized task force and invaded the compound. He found Lawthrown in hiding, put a bag over his head, and executed him. The decisive was deactivated. The incident was disguised as a gas leak. Since then, Every B.O.L.D. was killed in the raid, killed themselves afterwards, or in hiding. They have all received pardons as long as they take anti-cult therapy.</p></b>



<h4>A.T.E.</h4>
<b><p>Despite victory against B.O.L.D., public opinion on The New Order government was at an all time low. Some say this was due to Lawthrown telling the public that the Government is very secretive, combined with the information leak of Terminus. President Brandon, who was on Shore Leave in Michigan, decided it was his duty to do something. He found an online chatroom primarily used for a group of college friends. He found that they often meet in a Warehouse in Chicago. He diverted the conversation to The New Order, and was quickly accepted into the group. Little did he know that this was a branch of the far-left organization AntiFa. They exploited him, learning that The Order had no plans to stop alliances with the United States if Donald Trump were to win the election. Thus, they kicked him out of the group and formed the Anti Trump Empire, a terrorist cell that fought against what they thought was an oppressive government in the U.S. and The Order. It was quickly disbanded when Brandon returned. While they exploited him, the exploited them and had tons of secrets about them, mostly concerning their views on certain political issues being against the norm of the group. He threatened to publish these online if they did not disband, so they did.</p></b>




<h4>Morton 12</h4>
<p><b>2019 proved to be an important year, starting with this discovery. Morton 12 was a planet only a few light years away. It seemed capable of supporting life. Unfortunately, we lost any visual/audio/radar contact with it one day.</b></p>



<h4>Bagan and Yo’g Abo’th</h4>
<p><b>The same day Morton 12 contact was lost, a gigantic creature was seen emerging from the sea. The creature was incredibly strong, capable of high-powered emissions, creating a long, wide string of superheated molecules above his horn, regeneration and was radioactive. It destroyed half of Capital City, before MOGERA was sent out to defeat it out at sea. Commander John Sequia took control of Star Wolf, the flying top-half of MOGERA. He shoot a hole in Bagan’s chest and flew Star Wolves arm into it. He activated a short-ranged high-powered burst blast, destroy both entities. Sequoia received post-humerus honors. 3 days later, a psychic transmission was sent to everyone on earth. It said that it was the voice of Yo’g Abo’th, one of the Great Elder Gods, creators of much life in the universe including earth. He said he was very disappointed in the planet. He claimed to be behind the destruction of Morton 12. He compared the history of mankind to Calhoun's “Mouse Utopia experiments”.  He gave the planet 1 week to prepare for destruction.
