<h1>How it all began</h1>
	<b><p> The New Order is a game me and a couple friends made up back when we were in seventh grade, but specifically it was between September or October of 2015. At first, it was only Brandon Rother, Taylor Bryan, and of course myself. During this first era of "The New Order" we did have a couple others that were interested, but we decided to make them villians, just so we would actually have a story other than just "we rebelled from the bad guys" because honestly, having that be the only thing that happened would make it a pretty boring game. Sadly though, in June of 2016, Brandon ended up moving. We were still able to keep in contact with him, and I think we made the game last until part way into the eigth grade, but inevitably we kind of forgot about it and went on to do different writing projects.<br><br>
	That is until 2019, when I kind of remembered it out of the blue and wanted to start it back up again. I talked to Brandon about this (which he was pretty open to doing) and we basically just started it back up. I also wanted to recruit more members and I knew the perfect person to ask, that person was Paul Leedy. Paul and I were in the same boy scout troop and would talk about sci-fi, video games, etc. Anyway, I went to a boy scout meeting one night and told him about "The New Order", despite me being pretty bad at explaining things. He accepted my invitation, so I ended up sharing all of the New Order documents that we had with him, and we were well on our way to a revival of The New Order. Although, Paul had the impression that we were just a country on the planet Earth, when instead it was more based off of Star Wars. Although, we decided to try "The New Order" Paul's way just to see how it would play out, and we actually got a scenario or two going for a while, which was great, until early 2020. Once Covid hit and shut down the school for the rest of the year, I think we all kind of went our separate ways and thus "The New Order" was on hiatus again.<br><br>
	During my senior year in late 2020 is when I originally wanted to make a website for The New Order, but since I did not know the first thing about developing or designing websites, that dream had to be put on hold, until now anyway. About a couple months ago, I told Brandon that I was thinking about making a website for "The New Order" since I was taking a Web Design class in college, making it my best chance to do so yet. He was pretty open to that idea, but first I wanted to know what canon he wanted to use for the website, which he responded with the heavily inspired by Star Wars canon, officially rendering Paul's contributions non-canon, but since we did quite a bit with him, it would be quite disrespectful for us to just delete everything he did and call it a day, so instead I dedicated an entire section of this website to Paul's contributions, which is the non-canon events.</p>	</b>
